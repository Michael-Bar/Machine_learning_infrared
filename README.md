# Overview

These scripts use mid-infrared spectroscopy data to predict soil properties. They represent a significant edit and improvement over the base ICRAF scripts (in that they actually work for One Acre Fund data, produce bootstrap CIs, and allow easy expansion for additional methods). They have since been picked up by Max Sop at One Acre Fund for further improvement.
